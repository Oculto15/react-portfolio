# Overview

I decided to create my own portfolio by using React Framework. I used Next.js and Tailwindcss. To be able to run this program, first I need to create a new project by using npx create-next-app@latest project-name, then I need to install Tailwindcss, npm install -D tailwindcss and then npx tailwindcss init. To run the program I need to use npm run dev.

The purpose of this project to to create my own portfolio so I can show my projects in a better way. Also, to have the opportunity to learn more about React.

Besides React, I also used nextjs and tailwindcss. With the purpose of learning different libraries and how they work.
